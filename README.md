## Volatility Modeling & Time Series Analysis

This project explores how market volatility changes over time and how
volatility forecasts, such as GARCH(1,1), can be used to adjust risk in a simple trading strategy.

The focus is on learning Exam SRM & PA content rather than maximizing returns. If one wants to predict the direction in which a stock is going, other strategies are recommended.
